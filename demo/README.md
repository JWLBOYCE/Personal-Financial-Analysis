# Demo Data

This folder contains safe demonstration files for the Personal Financial Analysis project.

- `demo_transactions.csv` is a short sample bank statement with three transactions.
- `demo_finance.sql` can be used to create a small SQLite database with matching data.
- `demo_finance.db` will be generated automatically from the SQL file when demo mode is enabled.

These files are provided for testing and demo mode only and do not contain any sensitive information.
